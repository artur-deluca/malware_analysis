## Machine learning for cybersecurity

This project contains an overview of cybersecurity and malicious software inspection strategies. 

This report is followed by an illustrative experiment that uses machine learning to identify compiler provenance its degree of optimization based on a database of malware binary code extracted from [Massarelli et al. 2019]( https://ruoyuwang.me/bar2019/pdfs/bar2019-paper20.pdf)
