	abstract = {State of Cybersecurity 2019 reports the results of the annual ISACA® global State of Cybersecurity Survey, conducted
in November 2018. Some findings reinforce discoveries from prior years—specifically, that the top attacks
and threat actors remain largely the same. Other findings provide new insight for cybersecurity management:
respondents indicate that cybersecurity departments are best served when reporting to either a chief information
security officer (CISO) or chief executive officer (CEO), rather than reporting to a chief information officer (CIO).
State of Cybersecurity 2019 captures an outlook on cybersecurity from the perspective of those who define
the field—cybersecurity managers and practitioners. This second of two reports focuses on current trends in
cybersecurity attack vectors and response methodologies, organizational governance and program management.},

introduced to evaluation tasks of information extraction technology
at the Fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4) in 1992.
Recently, sometimes I see some confusion with the definition of the Fmeasure, which seems to be triggered by lack of background knowledge
about how the F-measure was derived. Since I was not involved in the
process of the introduction or device of the F-measure, I might not be
the best person to explain this but I hope this note would be a little
help for those who are wondering what the F-measure really is. This
introduction is devoted to provide brief but sufficient information on
the F-measure.},

Skewed class distribution causes a misreading of common evaluation measures as well it lead a biased classification. This article presents a set of alternative for imbalanced data learning assessment, using a combined measures (G-means, likelihood ratios, Discriminant power, F-Measure Balanced Accuracy, Youden index, Matthews correlation coefficient), and graphical performance assessment (ROC curve, Area Under Curve, Partial AUC, Weighted AUC, Cumulative Gains Curve and lift chart, Area Under Lift AUL), that aim to provide a more credible evaluation.

biased and should not be used without clear understanding of the biases, and corresponding identification of chance

Informedness, can appear to perform better under any of these commonly used measures. We discuss several
concepts and measures that reflect the probability that prediction is informed versus chance. Informedness and
introduce Markedness as a dual measure for the probability that prediction is marked versus chance. Finally we
demonstrate elegant connections between the concepts of Informedness, Markedness, Correlation and Significance
as well as their intuitive relationships with Recall and Precision, and outline the extension from the dichotomous case
to the general multi-class case.},

Program provenance answers fundamental questions of malware analysis and software forensics, such as whether programs are generated by similar tool chains; it also can allow development of debugging, performance analysis, and instrumentation tools specific to particular compilers. We formulate compiler identification as a structured learning problem, automatically building models to recognize sequences of binary code generated by particular compilers. We evaluate our techniques on a large set of real-world test binaries, showing that our models identify the source compiler of binary code with over 90\% accuracy, even in the presence of interleaved code from multiple compilers. A case study demonstrates the use of inferred compiler provenance to augment stripped binary parsing, reducing parsing errors by 18\%.},
